#### Docker
___

    This project leverages Docker to simplify the distribution of our static web application. The key steps include:

- Exporting our Jupyter Notebook to HTML format.
- Creating a Docker image that contains the static HTML web application.
- Using NGINX as the web server within the Docker container to serve the application.

    By using Docker, we ensure the application is easy to distribute and run consistently across different environments.


#### Jupyter Notebook
___

    To share and visualize our findings, we use Jupyter Notebooks, which we find to be an ideal format for this purpose. Jupyter Notebooks seamlessly combine code, plots, and discussion into a single interactive document, making it easy to present and explore insights.

    Additionally, Jupyter Notebooks can be exported as HTML files, which we use as the foundation for our static web application. This approach allows us to effectively share our results in a format accessible through any web browser.
